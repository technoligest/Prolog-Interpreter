# Prolog-Interpreter

This is an interpretor for an LL1 language which is specified in lang.pdf.

To run the program you can use any prolog environment to consult and run the program. SWI Prolog is reccommended.

To run the program run "run_program( FileName, Arguments, Result )" by inputting the name of the file into 'FileName',
the arguments to go into the main method, and just a variable Result to hold the output of the program.
